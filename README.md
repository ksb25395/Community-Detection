# Community-Detection
This project is done as a final Capstone project for the Coursera OOP Specialization by UC San Deigo.

Community Detection in Complex Networks.

Detect Communities in Complex Networks using Girvan Newman Algorithm based on Betweenness Measure and the Newman's Fast Greedy Algorithm for community detection using modularity.

## Running
* To see the Girvan Newman algorithm in action, run the `main` method as a driver in `SocialNetworks/src/graph/
CapGraph.java`. Algorithm is based on the following research paper : http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/99/12/7821.full.pdf

* To see the Newman's greedy algorithm in action, run the `main` method as a driver in `SocialNetworks/src/graph/
FastNewmanImpl.java`. Algorithm is based on the following research paper : http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/103/23/8577.full.pdf
