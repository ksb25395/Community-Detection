# Community-Detection
Community Detection in Complex Networks.

Detect Communities in Complex Networks using Girvan Newman Algorithm based on Betweenness Measure and the Newman's Fast Greedy Algorithm for community detection using modularity.

## Running
* To see the Girvan Newman algorithm in action, run the `main` method as a driver in `CapGraph.java`

* To see the Newman's greedy algorithm int action, run the `main` method as a driver in `FastNewmanImpl.java`
